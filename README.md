# Express.js Silent Error in Async Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Express.js applications where an asynchronous operation within a route handler throws an error, but the error is not properly handled, resulting in a silent failure. The client receives no response, making it difficult to debug.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js application with a route handler that performs an asynchronous operation. If this operation throws an error, the error is logged to the console, but no response is sent to the client. This leads to a hanging request and a poor user experience.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct way to handle errors in asynchronous route handlers. By using a `try...catch` block or a `.catch` handler and sending an appropriate error response to the client, we ensure that the user receives feedback even in case of errors.

## How to reproduce the bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `node bug.js`.
4. Make a request to `http://localhost:3000/`. The request will hang.

## How to fix the bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `node bugSolution.js`.
4. Make a request to `http://localhost:3000/`.  The request will return an error response.
